# Apple Health & Freestyle Libre 3 Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on personal Apple Health XML export and Freestyle Libre 3 glucose monitoring data, demonstrating SQL operations, pandas analysis, and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Raw, processed, and database directories
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis  
- `src/` - Python modules for data processing
- `sql/` - Database schema and queries
- `outputs/` - Generated plots and reports

## Environment Setup
- Conda environment: `health-analysis`
- Python 3.11 with data science packages
- Jupyter Lab for interactive analysis

## Key Features
- Apple Health XML parsing
- Freestyle Libre CSV processing
- SQL-based data merging and analysis
- Machine learning models for glucose prediction
- Professional visualizations and reporting

## Getting Started
1. Activate environment: `mamba activate health-analysis`
2. Place health data files in `data/raw/`
3. Run Jupyter Lab: Use VS Code task "Start Jupyter Lab"
4. Execute notebooks in order: `01_data_extraction.ipynb`, etc.

## Analysis Goals
- Demonstrate SQL (data management, joins, aggregations)
- Demonstrate pandas/ML (analysis, modeling)
- Use personal physiological data for insights
- Create shareable, professional analysis
